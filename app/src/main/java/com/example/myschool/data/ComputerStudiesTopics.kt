        1. What is a Computer?
        A computer is an electronic device that accepts data, processes it, stores it, and produces a result (output). It operates under the control of a set of instructions.

        2. Characteristics of Computers
        - **Speed:** Computers can perform millions of calculations in a second.
        - **Accuracy:** Computers are very accurate. Errors are usually caused by humans (Garbage In, Garbage Out - GIGO).
        - **Storage:** They can store vast amounts of data for future use.
        - **Diligence:** A computer can work for long hours without getting tired or bored.
        - **Versatility:** Computers can perform a wide variety of tasks.

        3. History of Computers (Generations)
        - **First Generation (1940s-1950s):** Used vacuum tubes. They were huge, expensive, and produced a lot of heat. (e.g., ENIAC, UNIVAC).
        - **Second Generation (1950s-1960s):** Used transistors, which were smaller, faster, and more reliable than vacuum tubes.
        - **Third Generation (1960s-1970s):** Used Integrated Circuits (ICs), which placed many transistors on a single chip. Computers became smaller and more powerful.
        - **Fourth Generation (1970s-Present):** Use microprocessors (an entire CPU on a single chip). This led to the development of personal computers (PCs).
        - **Fifth Generation (Present and Beyond):** Focuses on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and parallel processing.
