        1. What is Biology?
        Biology is the natural science that studies life and living organisms, including their physical structure, chemical processes, molecular interactions, physiological mechanisms, development, and evolution.

        2. Branches of Biology
        - **Zoology:** The study of animals.
        - **Botany:** The study of plants.
        - **Microbiology:** The study of microorganisms.
        - **Genetics:** The study of heredity and variation.
        - **Ecology:** The study of the interactions between organisms and their environment.

        3. Characteristics of Living Organisms
        All living organisms share several key characteristics:
        - **Nutrition:** The process of obtaining and processing food.
        - **Respiration:** The release of energy from food.
        - **Movement:** A change in position or location.
        - **Growth:** An irreversible increase in size and complexity.
        - **Excretion:** The removal of waste products.
        - **Reproduction:** The ability to produce offspring.
        - **Irritability (Sensitivity):** The ability to respond to stimuli.

        4. The Cell
        The cell is the basic structural and functional unit of all known living organisms. It is the smallest unit of life that can replicate independently.
        - **Cell Theory:**
            - All living organisms are composed of one or more cells.
            - The cell is the basic unit of life.
            - All cells arise from pre-existing cells.

        1. The Five Kingdoms
        Living organisms are classified into five major kingdoms:
        - **Monera:** Unicellular organisms that lack a nucleus (prokaryotes), such as bacteria.
        - **Protista (Protoctista):** Mostly unicellular eukaryotic organisms, such as amoeba, algae, and protozoa.
        - **Fungi:** Multicellular, eukaryotic organisms that are heterotrophic, such as mushrooms, yeast, and mold.
        - **Plantae:** Multicellular, eukaryotic organisms that are autotrophic (perform photosynthesis), such as mosses, ferns, and flowering plants.
        - **Animalia:** Multicellular, eukaryotic organisms that are heterotrophic, such as insects, fish, and mammals.

        2. Binomial Nomenclature
        - **Definition:** A two-term naming system for all living organisms. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs, and the second part identifies the species.
        - **Example:** *Homo sapiens* (Humans), where *Homo* is the genus and *sapiens* is the species.

        3. Viruses
        - **Characteristics:** Viruses are not considered true living organisms because they are acellular and can only reproduce inside a living host cell.
        - **Structure:** A virus consists of genetic material (DNA or RNA) surrounded by a protein coat (capsid).
