    Topic("sentences", "Sentences",
        """
        A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. A complete sentence must have at least a subject and a predicate (verb).

        Components of a Sentence:
        -   Subject: Who or what the sentence is about.
        -   Predicate: What the subject does or is. It contains the verb.

        Example: The clever student reads a thick book.
        -   Complete Subject: The clever student
        -   Complete Predicate: reads a thick book

        Understanding Clauses:
        A clause is a group of words with a subject and a verb.
        -   Independent Clause: Expresses a complete thought and can stand alone as a sentence. (e.g., The dog barked.)
        -   Dependent (or Subordinate) Clause: Cannot stand alone as a complete sentence. It depends on an independent clause to form a complete thought. (e.g., ...because it was hungry.)

        Types of Sentences by Structure:
        1.  Simple Sentence: Contains one independent clause.
            -   Example: The cat slept.
        2.  Compound Sentence: Contains two or more independent clauses, joined by a conjunction.
            -   Example: The cat slept, and the dog barked.
        3.  Complex Sentence: Contains one independent clause and at least one subordinate clause.
            -   Example: The cat slept because it was tired.
        4.  Compound-Complex Sentence: Contains two or more independent clauses and at least one subordinate clause.
            -   Example: Because it was tired, the cat slept, and the dog barked.

        Types of Sentences by Purpose:

        1.  Declarative: Makes a statement. It ends with a full stop (.).
            -   Example: Lake Malawi is the third-largest lake in Africa.

        2.  Interrogative: Asks a question. It ends with a question mark (?).
            -   Example: Have you ever visited Likoma Island?

        3.  Imperative: Gives a command, makes a request, or gives instructions. The subject is often an implied 'you'.
            -   Example: Please pass the salt. / Go and do your homework.

        4.  Exclamatory: Expresses strong emotion or excitement. It ends with an exclamation mark (!).
            -   Example: What a beautiful sunset over the lake!

        Synopsis:
        The story centers on a young, idealistic judge named Ajala who is newly appointed to the bench in his town. He is determined to uphold justice and integrity, but he soon faces immense pressure from a corrupt and powerful chief, who expects him to bend the law for personal gain. The play explores the conflict between honesty and corruption, and the courage it takes to stand up for what is right.

        Character Analysis:
        - Judge Ajala: The protagonist. He is young, educated, and represents the force of modern justice and integrity. His main struggle is resisting bribery.

        This topic explores traditional Malawian folklore, which has been passed down through generations.

        Introduction:
        Malawian folk tales (nthano) are rich with moral lessons and often feature animal characters with human-like qualities. The clever rabbit (Kalulu) is a frequent protagonist who uses his wit to outsmart larger and more powerful animals like the hyena (Fisi) or the elephant (Njobvu). These stories teach virtues like humility, wisdom, and community, while warning against greed, jealousy, and foolishness.

        Features of Nthano:
        - *Moral Lessons*: Every story has a clear lesson at the end.
        - *Personification*: Animals talk, think, and act like humans.
        - *Repetition and Song*: Many stories include repetitive chants or songs that make them memorable.

        Example Story: Kalulu and the Elephant
        During a great drought, Njobvu the elephant finds a hidden well but selfishly keeps it secret. The other animals are thirsty. Kalulu the rabbit devises a clever plan. He flatters the elephant and tricks him into a dancing contest, which makes the elephant reveal the location of the well. The story teaches that intelligence and wit can be more powerful than brute strength.

        Overview:
        Malawian poets often write about themes of identity, freedom, social justice, and the beauty of the Malawian landscape. Their work reflects the country's history, from its colonial past to its post-independence struggles and triumphs. They use vivid imagery, metaphor, and rhythm to convey their messages.

        Key Poet: Jack Mapanje
        Jack Mapanje is one of Malawi's most celebrated poets. His work is known for its subtle criticism of political oppression. We will study his poem, "Before Chilembwe Tree," where he reflects on the legacy of the freedom fighter John Chilembwe and questions the meaning of freedom in modern Malawi. We will analyze his use of symbols and metaphors to convey his political message without being explicit.

        Synopsis:
        The novel chronicles the life of Okonkwo, a fierce and respected warrior in the Igbo village of Umuofia. The first part of the book details his personal story and the rich cultural and social fabric of his community. The second part depicts the arrival of European missionaries and colonial officials, and the profound, disruptive impact they have on Igbo society. Okonkwo, unable to adapt to the new order, finds himself on a path to a tragic end.

        -   *Masculinity*: Okonkwo's life is dominated by his narrow and destructive definition of what it means to be a man.

        A famous play by Nigerian writer Wole Soyinka, who became the first African to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.

        Synopsis:
        The play is set in the Yoruba village of Ilujinle. It tells the story of Sidi, the beautiful village belle (the "Jewel"), who is courted by two different men: Lakunle, a modern and arrogant schoolteacher who wants to "civilize" her, and Baroka, the elderly but cunning village chief (the "Lion"). The play is a comedic and satirical exploration of the conflict between traditional Yoruba culture and Western modernity.

        Character Analysis:
        - *Sidi*: The Jewel. She is beautiful but also vain and easily flattered. She is caught between the allure of modern fame and traditional power.
        - *Baroka*: The Lion. He is the cunning and powerful chief of the village. He represents tradition but is not opposed to using modern tricks to get what he wants.
        - *Lakunle*: The schoolteacher. He represents a naive and unthinking embrace of Western culture, despising everything traditional.

        Key Themes:
        -   *Modernity vs. Tradition*: The central theme, represented by the love triangle between Sidi, Baroka, and Lakunle.
        -   *The Role of Women*: The play explores female agency and how women navigate patriarchal power structures.
        -   *Cunning and Deception*: Baroka's victory is achieved through a clever and deceptive trick, questioning the nature of power.
