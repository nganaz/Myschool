        1. States of Matter: Solid, liquid, and gas are the three main states of matter. Their properties are explained by the Kinetic Theory of Matter, which describes the arrangement and movement of particles.
        2. Physical and Chemical Properties: Physical properties (e.g., color, density, melting point) can be observed without changing the substance's identity. Chemical properties (e.g., flammability, reactivity) describe how a substance reacts to form new substances.
        3. Physical and Chemical Changes: A physical change alters the form of a substance, but not its chemical composition (e.g., melting ice). A chemical change results in the formation of a new substance (e.g., burning wood).
        4. Mixtures and Pure Substances: Pure substances consist of only one type of element or compound. Mixtures consist of two or more substances that are not chemically combined. Mixtures can be homogeneous (uniform composition) or heterogeneous (non-uniform composition).
        5. Separation of Mixtures: Techniques are based on differences in physical properties. Examples include filtration (separating an insoluble solid from a liquid), evaporation (separating a soluble solid from a solvent), distillation (separating liquids with different boiling points), and chromatography (separating dissolved substances).
